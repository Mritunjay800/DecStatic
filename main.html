	<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Dumka, the Second Capital of Jharkhand is in Santhal Pargana, an under developed region of Jharkhand. Although Dumka is well connected by Bus from Ranchi, Patna, Kolkata & connected by Rail from Ranchi and Howrah, there was no Engineering College in that Region. The Govt. of Jharkhand thus established the 1st Engineering College inside Dumka Town and entrusted the trust to run the College to Techno India Group, the most respected group of the eastern India having Three Universities, 22 Engineering Colleges, Diploma Colleges, Business Schools, Hospital and so on and having more than 60,000 students and 5,00,000 alumni.At present the college is running UG engineering academic session with Computer Science & Engineering, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil and Electronics & Communications discipline of Engineering.
